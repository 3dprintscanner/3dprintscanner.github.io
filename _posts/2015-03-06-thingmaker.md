ThingMaker: 3D Printing & Scanning
---------------------------

Late 2012 - Early 2014
======================


ThingMaker was a project to find a workable business model around 3D printing and event services. We identified there was a need to have a fun and educational experience around 3D printing technology. At this point there was a significant amount of media attention around this growing technology and an appetite from the public to learn more.

We set about looking for ways of fulfiling this need and decided to work on building an experience.

We built a rudimentary 3D scanning rig for mounting a kinect-based sensor. This would pack into a suitcase and we would take this to events. 


Additionally we experimented with colour 3D printed busts, and build a website and code to automate the processing. The models would be associated with the person who had been scanned and uploaded to our web server, from there we would generate a WebGL viewer and email the person with a personalised webpage of their model. From that they could choose to buy a 3D printed bust of themselves.
