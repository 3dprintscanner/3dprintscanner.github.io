2014 NASA Space Apps Hackathon:
=============================



In the 2014 NASA space apps challenge our entry was one of the overall winners. The project was based on a conversation I had with a satellite internet provided who remarked he had a need to find a cheap way of tracking satellites on highly inclined and polar orbits.


Over the weekend we built an android application and physical prototype of a mobile satellite tracker.


This has potential use for hobbyists tracking the motion of satellites, especially cubesats and with further development could be a viable platform for lowering the costs of satelitte telecommunications in developing countries and at higher latitudes.
